# Findings and operational memory

## Tooling

Spago 1.0.4 uses env-paths and opens a SQLite cache database under the real
user directory. The sandbox rejected that access. scripts/cache.mjs overrides
Node's os.homedir in the Spago process only to .build/home; it does not modify
HOME or the installed tool. On this macOS host the normal cache at
~/Library/Caches/spago-nodejs was copied to
.build/home/Library/Caches/spago-nodejs to allow cached package resolution.
That cache is ignored and is not part of the deliverable. No reference source
was copied into this compiler. The adapter clears host XDG_CACHE_HOME/APPDATA/LOCALAPPDATA settings in the
Spago process so env-paths uses the workspace home on other platforms too.
Only macOS execution has been verified.

PureScript 0.15.16, Spago 1.0.4, purs-tidy 0.11.1, Go 1.26.4, and Node
26.6.0 are installed here. Spago's package set 81.0.0 declares a 0.15.15
baseline but compiles successfully under pinned 0.15.16. Strict builds caught
Prim.Type/Function name shadowing and a redundant tuples dependency; both
were fixed rather than suppressing warnings.

npm could not resolve registry.npmjs.org (ENOTFOUND) during a package-lock
attempt. Local npm dependencies were unnecessary: the pinned tools are PATH
prerequisites. No npm install is needed to verify this repository once tools
and PureScript caches are present. Online installation still needs a separate
network-capable validation; local issue F001 records this distinction.

## Compiler traps worth retaining

Go typed constant addition can reject overflowing expressions even though
runtime int32 addition wraps. Emit sprigAdd with int32 arguments rather than
folding source addition to a Go constant. Range-check source literals first.

PureScript is eager. maybe's computed fallback executes even for Just; use
maybe' with a named fallback function when work should be conditional.
Use either for Either; use maybe/maybe' for Maybe. Name record builders and
transformations in where, not just simple pass-through branches.

Resolved IDs are deterministic array indices. Local values shadow function
names in call position and are rejected as non-callable; no source names are
copied into Go identifiers. This avoids Go keyword and helper-name collisions.

Negative checks must validate the expected diagnostic, not any failure.
The mutant must compile before its rejection assertion is tested. Mutations
run in .build/regression and never change live sources or normal output.

## Reference documentation boundary

The user explicitly authorized a MileAhead guidance amendment. apply_patch
rejected /Users/ethan/Desktop/trailmapper/AGENTS.md with:
"writing outside of the project; rejected by user approval settings".
Do not claim it was changed and do not bypass the sandbox. The proposed patch
is in docs/patches/mileahead-eliminators.patch.

## Planning workflow

Plan, durable findings, and verification evidence must precede further broad
exploration. docs/plans/bootstrap.md owns task status; docs/progress.md owns
what actually ran; ADRs own decisions; BACKLOG.md owns future and unresolved
work. A future skill installation must not silently replace this convention.

purs-tidy 0.11.1 writes its version to stderr with success status. The version
gate checks the combined output exactly, rather than assuming stdout.

## Skills migration prerequisites

Escalated bunx installation and GitHub access succeeded on 2026-10-07; the
earlier npm DNS failure remains historical, not a claim of current outage.
Fresh compiler prerequisite installation/cross-platform builds remain untested.
All 15 pinned skills plus helper files are installed in .agents/skills.

At migration, Git had no commits: git rev-parse --verify HEAD reported "Needed a single
revision". task-start/task-done require HEAD/BASE and review-package requires
commit ranges; do not invoke them until a real checkpoint exists (W001).
Sandboxed git status also emitted xcrun temporary-cache permission errors;
escalated Git inspection worked. Record this environment distinction (F003).

The reviewed pinned writing-plans uses self-review rather than a plan-review
subagent. At migration the audit plan was self-reviewed only; execution had not begun. Existing docs stay durable even when scratch is cleaned.

## Bootstrap audit findings

Computed record/error fallbacks in Lex.scan, Parse.Core.failAt,
Parse.Expression.integer, Resolve lookups, and Check.checkLocal used eager
maybe. They now use maybe' with named fallback functions. Context-dependent
traverse/filter callbacks in checking/resolution are named in where. Resolver
globals moved from an independent do-let to where. Branch rendering/building
work was extracted and private Parse.Core plumbing is no longer exported.

Architecture prose overstated defensive E_INTERNAL coverage: Check checks
local/call indices during inference, but trusts the resolved entry/table
structure. Documentation now states that exact contract. The CLI respects an
existing GOCACHE; README now describes its default, rather than an override.

The ten-arm (now twelve; see BACKLOG E003) codeName mapping exceeds the eight-branch review target; splitting
a short exhaustive ADT tag mapping would obscure its wire contract. E003
records it explicitly. Other declaration budgets were reviewed manually;
module/file limits remain automatically checked. The Spago no-files message
for test/**/*.purs is informational: tests are Node .mjs files. Actual strict
build tables report zero warnings/errors; no message was suppressed.

A setup command accidentally ran an extra verification in the original root
after worktree creation. It passed but is not the worktree baseline evidence.
The separate clean-output worktree run compiled 269 modules and passed 19
tests plus the regression proof; .build/audit-baseline.log in the worktree
is the actual evidence. Both locations' previous outputs were preserved.

Task 1 verification initially failed with ModuleNotFound for
Sprig.IResolved.Internal. A naive R.-to-Resolved. replacement also matched
the suffix of IR.; it corrupted the import and IR references in Check.purs.
The replacement is corrected, not retried unchanged. The original failure
is preserved in the execution workspace task-1-failed-alias.log. A copied
defective source tree independently failed purs compile with the same missing
module in .build/alias-regression/failure.log. The build itself detects this
edit failure; no gate or assertion was disabled.

The isolated reproduction helper incorrectly expected diagnostics only on
stderr, while purs wrote them on stdout. That helper assertion failed before
the live fix ran, and its trailing verify re-observed the still-broken build
in .build/audit-task-1-fixed.log. Inspected the combined saved output, confirmed
the expected missing module, then corrected live IR references. Those logs
remain evidence of the failed attempts, not successful fix evidence.

Execution setup resolved W001 with baseline 9624bec and the user-authorized
audit/bootstrap-docs worktree. Full verification from clean output passed
there, and Task 1 changes are committed at 4410609. Docs are handoff artifacts,
not evidence that unimplemented ADTs or hostile-IR validation exist.

The fresh whole-branch review found no blockers and one minor item: two test
titles overstate assertions (E004). The existing named-helper fixture uses
maybe 0, not a computed maybe' fallback; the snapshot test makes one direct
compile, not repeated CLI invocations. Manual repeated CLI emissions now
independently agree. These titles are deferred per executor minor-finding
policy, without weakening the tests or overstating their automated coverage.

## A001 closure observations (2026-10-07)

- F004 reproduced during Task 6: a promoted strict warning appears only on the
  build that compiles the module. Clean-output verify is the workaround; the
  fix is open in BACKLOG.md.
- Four `sprig-regression-*` directories from earlier Task 3-era probe runs
  remain in $TMPDIR; a clean verify did not add any. Tracked as F005.
- The nil-guard policy deliberately does not validate fields skipped by
  wildcards or binders (ADR 003); this is a documented limit, not a defect.
- `E_USAGE`, `E_IO`, `E_TOOL` are strings in Format.Wire (A005).

## A001 final review fixes (2026-10-07)

- A function/constructor clash was reported at the constructor even when the
  function came first, because constructors were checked before functions and
  the program keeps the two in separate arrays. Source order is now recovered
  from span offsets. Record: docs/plans/closed-adts-review.md.
- Random flat multi-arm matches are often redundant (an arm subsumed by an
  earlier one), so the flat execution property uses a seed whose programs are
  all accepted, asserted to reach a third arm and the `_` tail.
- The old coverage oracle passed a mutant that offers uninhabited
  constructors; only the generated-type-system test catches it.

## F004 fix (2026-10-07)

- purs recompiles a workspace module whose output directory is missing, so
  deleting only workspace module outputs is enough; a full clean is not
  needed. Each build now recompiles the 32 workspace modules (about 1 s).
- The strict-rebuild proof copies output and .spago (about 40 MB) into
  .build/strict-rebuild and shares .build/home by symlink; verify takes
  about 8 s longer. It deletes the copy only on success, leaving it for
  inspection after a failure.

## A003 observations (2026-10-07)

- Test time is dominated by `go build`, one binary per executed program, not
  by the JavaScript runtime (BACKLOG T001).
- A second quadratic resolver cost survived Task 3b: `uniqueTypes`,
  `uniqueCtors` and `typeInfo` (which filtered every constructor per type).
  The final-review fix wave made them Repeated-based or linear.
- Go emission searched the type table per constructor (`tagOf`) and every
  constructor per type (Show), so 20,000 one-constructor types took 25.7 s
  to compile; one constructor layout per program (Format.Go.Layout) brought
  it to 0.2 s with byte-identical output. Many-declaration tests should cover
  every declaration kind, not just functions.
- Go `==` on generated structs would compare field pointers, so comparison
  always goes through generated helpers (ADR 005).
- Printed values reproduce themselves under the same declarations: the
  witness format minus `_` is valid source, which made the print round trip
  a strong printer test. Re-reading is bounded by E002 (constructor nesting
  overflows the parser at about 420 levels in a cold process).
- The coverage-oracle LCG used low bits that alternate, so seeds were
  reselected in Task 3b with assertions unchanged.

## G001 observations (2026-10-07)

- An applicative-only `Parser` was enough for the whole grammar because
  every choice is LL(1) on the next token (`dispatch`); the only sequencing
  on parsed values is `refine`, which checks a value without consuming.
  The style gate is syntactic, so it also bans `run`/`initialState`
  imports outside Format.Parse: running a sub-parser and inspecting its
  result would be Bind by another route.
- The combinator layers cost more stack per nesting level than the
  hand-written parser (cold `Cons(1, ` capacity fell from about 419 to 313
  levels in Task 2), so the limit was derived from a measured minimum
  (304, ADR 006) rather than chosen first; 128 also bounds printed lists,
  replacing the A003 note above about 420 levels.
- Breadth overflows hid in three more places once the parser stopped
  crashing first: the resolver's Array.foldM (about 1,700 arms or
  arguments), Coverage.redundancy's Array.foldM (about 1,929 arms) and
  Usefulness's two constructor searches (about 2,000 constructors).
  Array.foldM over Either nests one bind per item; `traverse` is balanced
  and `tailRecM` loops, so both are safe.
- The G001 final review found two more that the breadth tests missed,
  because those tests declared wide types but never matched on them:
  usefulness and algorithm I recursed once per pattern column (a
  1,600-field constructor pattern overflowed) and the inhabitation fixed
  point recursed once per pass, one pass per link of a type chain (3,000
  chained types overflowed). A per-item recursion hides wherever a test
  only exercises declaration size; test each phase at width. Also,
  Array.modifyAtIndices nests one ST bind per index and overflows between
  6,000 and 8,000 indices, so the new worklist sets flags in chunks.
- Go's inliner expands nested immediately invoked closures exponentially:
  a match nested 24 deep took 34.6 s and 7.5 GB to build (BACKLOG E005).
  Lowering each match to a named top-level function removed the blow-up
  (128 nested matches build in 0.14 s); an emitter shape that is cheap in
  PureScript can still be pathological for the target's optimizer, so
  depth tests must build and run, not only emit.
- A flat sum counts one level per operator, so 130 operands are E_NESTING
  although the phases overflow only near 2,928 operands (ADR 006 table);
  lifting it needs iterative chains in every later phase (BACKLOG O001).
## Language-direction planning gap (2026-10-08)

Review of the direction document identified an untracked prerequisite:
the current IR has named Call but no function values/lambdas/closures.
FN001 now follows P001 before C001/R001/FX001. Joint class/record design
must consider a shared record-of-functions representation. Row-layout
specialization growth and polymorphic fields are distinct risks; a fallback
is an option, not an approved change to ADR 002. Default lowered-IR position
is after specialization and above layouts. D001 records text/numeric/
collection foundations alongside M001; FX001 compares ZIO/Koka families.
No P001 code or active worktree changed.

The source-language effect system was only a phrase in I001 and the
self-hosting roadmap; compiler Host ports do not implement it. Recorded
FX001 for a dedicated design coordinated with rows/classes/FFI. Current
discussion and unsettled choices are in
docs/plans/2026-10-08-language-direction.md. "Hostable" was clarified to
mean inspectable intermediate representations, so no embedding VM was
selected. Rows simplify service requirements but do not decide runtime
resource/cancellation semantics. Documentation only; no feature implemented.

## P001 observations (2026-10-08)

- A source nesting limit does not bound inferred types. Composing generic
  calls multiplies depth (`fn deep(x: a): L^127(a)` nested 44 deep infers
  about 5,600 levels within every source limit), and the unifier, resolve
  and the occurs check recurse over type structure, so a legal program
  crashed with a RangeError (Task 4). Ruling R7 added the inferred-type
  bound (ADR 007), and it took three fix rounds to make it hold:
  1. Fix 1 checked each expression's type when built, both operands
     before each unification and each finished body. Review found that
     metas bound earlier in the same unification chain into each other,
     so two operands that were each within the bound unified as chains
     about 1,780 deep and still overflowed. Fix 1 also stated a 5x margin
     using resolve's overflow figure; unify, the binding limit, gives
     about 1.5x.
  2. Fix 2 threaded a level through unification (one per applied type
     entered, which equals resolved depth) and failed past the limit.
     Review then found six or more L^997 links bound in one unification
     still overflowing, in `bindMeta`.
  3. The cause: `bindMeta` named `resolved = resolve subst ty` in a
     `where`, guarded by an `if exceedsLimit … then … else …` in the body.
     PureScript `where` (and `let`) bindings are strict: the compiled
     JavaScript evaluates every binding before the body runs, so the
     resolve ran before the guard that was meant to prevent it. Fix 3
     moved the resolve into `bindBounded`, a function called only after
     the bound, and audited the compiled output of Features.Check* for
     other strict bindings that recurse over a type (all run on bounded
     types).
  Lesson: in PureScript, a `where` binding is not lazy; anything a guard
  must protect belongs in a helper function called from the guarded
  branch (AGENTS.md's `maybe'` rule exists for the same reason). And a
  bound is only as good as the deepest path that runs before it; review
  each recursion, not each entry point.
- Whole-type keys hide quadratic and exponential costs: Task 6's coverage
  keys made a 3,000-type growing chain take 16.6 s, and argument-doubling
  chains give exponentially large keys. Specialize therefore hash-conses
  its keys (R15), numbering each ground application once; Expand still
  uses whole-type keys (BACKLOG E008).
- Regression mutants must change one thing the probe can see. The
  `spec-key` mutant keys only the data-type arguments of a type
  application, without their identity, so `List(List(Int))` and
  `List(List(Bool))` collide; the Go build then fails on mismatched
  struct types. Removing the occurs check does not loop forever: the
  cyclic binding is caught by the inferred-type bound (E_NESTING), so the
  `occurs` probe requires the exact E_TYPE text rather than any
  rejection.
- Binding direction is a complexity choice. Binding the older of two
  unbound metas to the newer chains siblings into one long path that
  every later walk follows (a 5,000-arm `Nothing` match took 15.8 s);
  binding newer to older keeps every sibling one link from the oldest
  (1.55 s). Union-find's rank heuristic is the general form; meta age is
  a free approximation here.
- A timing bound's headroom must survive the parallel test runner. A
  2.9 s workload under a 5 s bound failed once in three reviewer runs and
  every time with three suites at once; the fix was the workload (Expand's
  deep `Ord` key comparisons), not the bound or a rerun.
- A single cold compile costs about 1.4× the steady-state sum of its
  phases (JIT warm-up and GC), and the PureScript pipeline allocates
  about 15 KB per source byte (2.8 GB for the 150 KB match ladder before
  T003). Measure a timing test's workload as the test runs it, in a
  fresh process: T003's steady-state per-phase sum fell 332 → 237 ms,
  and the cold compile the test times 507 → 370 ms.
- `go build` is superlinear in the size of one Go function or
  expression even when the generated text is linear (FN001 Task 1,
  design §13): an `n`-argument application chain in one function is
  k ≈ 2 at n = 5,000 to 20,000, and a stage that unpacks `n` locals and
  makes an `n`-argument call is the superlinear part of the linked
  environment. Linear text is necessary, not sufficient; measure the Go
  build at the largest size a test claims, and judge growth by the
  exponent, not by a ratio bound (a "within 5 × 4" bound passed a 16.4×
  quadratic build).
- Go's own build cost is superlinear in the size of one function body
  even when its signature is not (FN001 Task 1 round 2: a 20,000-
  parameter signature is linear, k = 0.19; an ordinary body reading each
  parameter twice is k = 2.24 under today's n-ary convention). Linear
  generated text did not give linear `go build` for the tested large
  bodies (this does not show that no representation could); bound Go
  builds by measured times at stated sizes, and keep linearity claims
  for Bumpus's own phases.
- A mutant's survival is a claim about the tests run, not about the
  suite (FN001 Task 9): Task 8 recorded that derived `Eq`/`Ord` on
  `Domain.Type.Ty` "survives all Task 8 tests" after running five files,
  and the gap was carried forward; test/type-order.test.mjs (Task 2)
  fails on it with RangeError. Name the files a mutant was run against,
  and run the whole parallel phase before calling a defect uncaught.
- A lowering mutant should still emit Go that builds, so its probe fails
  on behavior (which body runs first, what prints), not on a Go type
  error; when the built code no longer has the representation a plan
  names (an uncurried value), restore the defect's effect (an eta
  adapter at the type's arity) and say so.

## FX001 Task 1: runtime shapes (2026-10-09)

Hand-written Go of effects design §4 (scripts/effect-probe.mjs; raw output
in .build/fx001-task1/, run3.log is the record). Host load averages 2.6-5.8
(`uptime` before and after each batch in the log), so timings are upper
bounds; five runs each, median (min-max), checksums matched everywhere.

| Configuration | Median ms (min-max) |
|---|---|
| 10^6 shallow installs | 18.3 (16.3-36.2) |
| 10^6 performs, depth 1 | 1.65 (1.62-1.77) |
| 10^6 performs, depth 100 | 79.8 (79.4-79.9) |
| 10^6 performs, depth 10,000 | 11,770 (11,567-12,012) |
| one abort across 1,000 unrelated `handle` frames | 34.9 (34.3-35.1) |
| one abort across 1,000 cleanup frames | 27.5 (27.1-27.8) |
| 100,000 caught aborts, depth 1 | 19.9 (19.3-20.5) |

| `go build`, lifted helpers | Median s (min-max) | Ratio to previous |
|---|---|---|
| 1,000 | 0.83 (0.81-1.17) | |
| 2,000 | 1.53 (1.51-1.56) | 1.84 |
| 4,000 | 2.91 (2.88-2.97) | 1.90 |

Observations, not a linearity proof: the ratios are close to 2 for 2x size.
Lookup is linear in depth (about 1.2 ns per link; 11.8 s at depth 10,000
justifies the cached-index follow-up for FX005, not a design change).
Installation is about 18 ns each (one heap allocation). A caught abort is
about 200 ns; an abort through 1,000 re-panicking frames costs about 35 us
per frame. Decision rule: every semantic check passed and the 4,000-helper
median 2.91 s is within 10 s, so the shapes are adopted. Pitfall recorded:
Go's build cache makes identical regenerated sources look 8x faster; vary
the source per repetition when timing builds. Design reading to confirm in
FX001 review: a cleanup failure of any kind while a typed abort is pending
turns it into an uncatchable defect listing both causes. Superseded by the
user 2026-10-09: `defer` must not fail (spec §2, §3), so only defects can
fail cleanup and a pending typed abort is never converted by a typed
cleanup failure.

## Waxwing migration baseline (2026-10-09)

The existing isolated FX001 worktree was clean at 3481468 (Tasks 1-3
committed), while main remained at 2084638 with its pre-existing editor
settings change. Rename work uses the FX001 checkpoint, not main.
Before production edits, `npm run verify` exited 1: 638/640 parallel tests
passed. fn-linear lambda took 1604.135291 ms against 1545 ms; mismatch
819.499333 ms against 525 ms. Serial tests and regression proofs were not
reached. Evidence `.build/waxwing-baseline-verify.log`; FN006 owns the
existing parallel-timing exposure and next action, with no bounds changed.
Historical findings and paths above remain unchanged by the rename.

Concurrent FX001 checker edits appeared during rename validation, outside
its source scope (Binding, Require, Subst, Unify, UnifyRow). Preserved their
diff/hashes under .build/waxwing-concurrent-*; do not revert or attribute
them to the rename. A later harvest smoke could not import Format.Parse
because output was absent; this is not evidence of a hook defect. Require a
paused worker and stable build before combined-tree validation. The rename
verify's twenty-thousand-declaration timing failure is recorded in T004.

The user confirmed the FX001 worker paused. Its eight modified files are
preserved (the previous five plus Domain.Type.Parts, Features.Resolve and
Features.Specialize.Seeds). Combined-tree verification builds cleanly but
fails test/unify-row.test.mjs:57: deferred Fail now returns Subst rather
than the test's RowMissing. R003 records the exact test and next action for
FX001; no assertion was changed by the rename. Five fn-linear timing
failures are recorded in FN006. An accidental extra combined-tree verify
ran from the wrong working directory; its separate failure log is
.build/waxwing-paused-extra-verify.log (636/640 pass). A subsequent log-move
command used that same wrong relative-path assumption and failed; the log
was then preserved at its correct path. These are execution mistakes, not
additional compiler defects. Isolated rename validation uses the original
3481468 versions of the eight worker files in a copy only, leaving live
files intact (.build/waxwing-validation-scope.json).


## FX001 Task 3 fix continuation (2026-10-09)

The inherited matching-path postponement still immediately rejected a
left-over deferred right label in finish. New row-deferred regression ran
first: 9/10 passed; the left-over case failed with RowExtra
(.build/fx001-task3-fix-red.log). Guarding that path by the resolved key
now postpones the entire pair with rollback, just like the matching path.
Focused post-fix run passed 44/44 (.build/fx001-task3-fix-focused.log).
The eight inherited source edits were preserved and completed; no fresh
RED history is claimed for their already-implemented behavior. Isolated
source mutants supply regression proof for those inherited fixes.

Operational failures: an exploratory read requested nonexistent
scripts/test.mjs (verify is scripts/verify.mjs); no check was omitted.
After the user interruption, the former focused-run session identifier no
longer existed; its complete 44-test TAP summary confirmed completion.
No duplicate build/verification was started. FN006's timing suite is
renamed to fn-linear-timing.serial.test.mjs with identical file contents,
under the user's authorized existing serial-runner policy.

The continuation's single clean-output full verify exited 1
(.build/fx001-task3-fix-verify.log): zero build warnings/errors, tidy,
strict-rebuild and structural gates passed; 643/644 parallel tests passed.
The sole failure was the existing match-lift ladder timing bound:
1670.670250 ms >1500. T003 records the exact evidence and next profiling
step; no bound/runner change or unchanged rerun hides it. Host load observed
afterward was 5.89/5.64/4.54, which does not establish causation. Serial
verification and regression proofs are run explicitly as the unreached
remainder, with separate logs and statuses.

Controller ruling after this reproduced T003 failure: apply the existing
fixed-bound scheduling policy by extracting only the deep/wide ladder
block into match-lift-timing.serial.test.mjs with its required imports.
All semantic match-lift tests remain parallel; the extracted block/source,
constants, assertion and 1500 ms bound are byte-identical
(.build/fx001-task3-fix-ladder-identity.txt). First serial continuation
passed 21/21 (.build/fx001-task3-fix-serial.log). A second clean-output full
verify follows the actual scheduling change, preserving the first failed
log; it is not an unchanged retry. No further scheduling iteration is
authorized blindly if another timing failure appears.

After the authorized scheduling extraction, the changed-tree clean-output
npm run verify exited 0: 643 parallel + 22 serial tests, no failures/skips,
zero build warnings/errors and all 22 existing regression proofs
(.build/fx001-task3-fix-verify-serial-scheduling.log). The ladder test took
410.995667 ms total against its unchanged 1500 ms timed-compilation bound.
The original failed log remains. No later-task effect syntax/runtime
behavior is claimed; deferred origin/provenance retention remains Task 9.


FX001 Task 4: omitted rows in lambda annotations cannot resolve as pure.
Resolve marks them with the signature's unwriteable ambient variable;
Check substitutes only that row slot with the lambda's fresh row. Named
row variables and type variables remain rigid. New Console callback and
legacy comparison diagnostics verify the distinction. Collecting signature
row variables must loop over long arrow spines, just as type collection
already did; a 20,000-arrow regression and restored-source mutant pin it.
Full verification: 672 parallel +22 serial tests, 22 existing proofs and
four new isolated source sensitivity checks (docs/progress.md).

FX001 Task 5: handler checking is complete through Check only. Rowless
`Handler(Name)` is ambiguous with an ADT application, so resolution prefers
a declared type named Handler and uses the effect interpretation only when
no such type exists. Explicit `with` makes the special type unambiguous.
Repeated duplicate scanning exposed a strictness trap: `when predicate
 (expensive Either)` evaluates the diagnostic computation even when the
predicate is false. Guarded branches keep it limited to actual collisions;
one combined repeated-name pass preserves constructor/function namespace
checking. The 20,000-type duplicate test is 475 ms after the fix (same 5 s
bound); an isolated restored-strictness mutation fails that workload's
timing assertion. Full Task 5 evidence and Task 9 deferred-row provenance
handoff: .superpowers/sdd/2026-10-09-effects-plan/task-5-report.md.

## Module boundaries and explicit instances (2026-10-10)

C001 already called for several selectable instances per type without
mandatory newtypes. The new modules-and-instance-selection direction expands
that requirement to dictionary construction and composition, and coordinates
it with M001/R001. Explicit selection removes implicit-choice ambiguity but
not ordering consistency in collections or obligations for algebraic laws.
Rust restricts orphan implementations; Haskell permits orphan instances with
GHC warnings. No compiler behavior changed or runtime guarantee established.

## Set-aside constraints must be judged, never dropped (FX009, 2026-10-10)

The scoped-label unifier sets aside a `Fail` pair whose key is not yet
known, and `settleRows` retries it. A pair that is never decided must
become a diagnostic. Before FX009 it was dropped, and a failure could
escape to run time. Any constraint deferred "until more is known" needs
an explicit final judgement. Rejecting malformed labels where they are
written (no family key) keeps the final guard a backstop rather than the
primary diagnostic.

## Schema and parsing boundaries (2026-10-10)

The roadmap mentioned schema ingress only as research, not a first-party
requirement. SCH001 now records the user's explicit direction. Effect and
schemata-ts connect parsing/encoding with test-data generation; schemata-ts's
Schemable interpretation is relevant to selectable class dictionaries. Derived
generators do not derive business properties, prove laws or independently
validate a parser generated from the same description. Arbitrary predicates
and lossy transforms need explicit support and codec-specific laws.

SCH001 precedent comparison (2026-10-10): the interpreter-parametric idea
has a direct io-ts precedent and broader tagless-final literature. ZIO
Schema supports the multi-interpretation goal through a different encoding.
Effect also has an AST and interpreter customization. Library-specific
conveniences do not establish architectural superiority; io-ts's relevant
API is explicitly experimental. Details/sources in schema-direction.
