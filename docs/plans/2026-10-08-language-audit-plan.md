# Cross-language design audit (LA001)

Recorded 2026-10-08 at the user's request. Status: planned research/review,
not an executed audit or authorization to implement features. STD001's
helper inventory is narrower; this audit covers language, library and
runtime design. Source landing pages have been checked, not fully reviewed.

**Goal:** establish a coherent, practically sufficient FP language feature
set with defensible semantics, explicit omissions and source-backed
decisions. Avoid both accidental gaps and feature accumulation for its
own sake. Preserve lawful generic abstractions and approachable APIs.

**Method:** read primary specifications, reports, reference manuals,
maintainer guides and API/law documentation; write independent comparative
notes. A tutorial/précis is an entry point, not evidence for a disputed
semantic claim. Distinguish languages from libraries and runtimes, and
standard features from implementation-specific extensions.

SCH001 adds a targeted supplementary comparison, not another full roster
brief: [schemata-ts](https://github.com/rae-hill/schemata-ts), supplied by the
user 2026-10-10. Compare its Schemable interpreters, Transcoder and Arbitrary
with Effect Schema (distinguishing v3/v4 APIs), explicit dictionaries and
Waxwing boundary parsing. Scope: docs/plans/2026-10-10-schema-direction.md.

All twelve are required roster entries. Add other references only to answer
a documented gap/question, with an explicit scope note; do not let "etc."
turn the audit into an unbounded bibliography.

## Common comparison axes

1. Values, evaluation order, strictness/laziness, closures, currying,
   local bindings, recursion, termination and stack safety.
2. Type/kind inference, annotations, HKTs, polymorphism/generalization,
   constraints, instance selection/coherence and abstraction boundaries.
3. ADTs, exhaustive patterns, records/open rows, error sums, refinements,
   numeric/text semantics and persistent collections.
4. Effects: requirement tracking, provision, construction versus execution,
   normal/abortive/multiple resumptions, typed failures versus defects,
   resource cleanup, async/cancellation/concurrency and evaluation order.
5. Standard-library breadth, laws, reusable generic operations, naming,
   module organization and interoperability of the same abstractions.
6. Modules/imports, public interfaces, FFI validation, specialization,
   target-neutral IR, runtime layouts, backend constraints and code growth.
7. Diagnostics, documentation, formatting, editor support, testing,
   packaging and realistic full-stack/native application needs.
   Include the user's tooling requirements: highlighting/IDE services,
   first-class doctests, property testing, possible literate capabilities,
   and versioned LLM skills/discovery (IDE001/DOC001/PBT001/LIT001/AI001).
   Distinguish compiler features from libraries and ecosystem tools.
   Include PKG001: portable compiled libraries, host-callable exports,
   typed FFI, dependency-inverted service adapters and package management
   spanning Waxwing and host dependencies. Review Effect Platform as a
   versioned precedent, separating targets from runtime capabilities.

### Diagnostic research cases (added 2026-10-09 for FX001)

At the user's request, PureScript's diagnostic problems are research cases
for axis 7, feeding FX001's diagnostic-quality section
(docs/plans/2026-10-09-effects-design.md §6). Collect concrete, reproduced
examples (MileAhead in read-only ../trailmapper is one source) before
characterizing them; the questions below are to investigate, not findings:
row-unification errors that print whole rows rather than the difference;
open-row tails shown as generated names rather than user names; reported
spans at a declaration or a distant unification instead of the
originating call; long "while checking/while trying to match" context
stacks; Variant-based error rows exposing carrier types; and lacks or
duplicate-label errors on composed records. For each, record the source
program, the compiler version, the message, what a user needed to know,
and the FX001 §6 rule that addresses it (or a gap).

Use these axes for comparable briefs; mark absent/not applicable topics
explicitly. Bibliography size and matching feature names are not sufficient
evidence of coverage or semantic compatibility.

## Task 1: Freeze sources and Waxwing baseline

- [ ] Create docs/research/language-audit/sources.md with reference kind,
  edition/version/revision, exact sections/links, access date and reading
  status (unread, surveyed, deeply reviewed, unavailable).
- [ ] Record existing Waxwing behavior against tests/ADRs separately from
  approved designs, direction-only proposals and missing features.
- [ ] Index all relevant core/reference sections and record which are read,
  deferred as irrelevant, or blocked. Do not claim a whole spec was read
  when only a summary or selected chapters were inspected.

## Task 2: Read the roster and produce comparative briefs

- [ ] Produce one brief per reference under docs/research/language-audit/.
  Read relevant core chapters and pursue primary sources for detailed
  claims; update the section ledger and explain deliberate omissions.
- [ ] Each brief states the problem solved, precise semantics/laws,
  strengths, tradeoffs, rejected/invalid examples, user experience and
  relevance to Waxwing. Label source-backed facts versus our inferences.
- [ ] Reproduce small disputed examples with the source toolchain when
  feasible; record version/results or the inability to run them. A reading
  claim is not an execution claim. Reference projects remain read-only;
  no unlicensed implementation is copied.

## Task 3: Build the feature and interaction matrix

- [ ] Create docs/research/language-audit/matrix.md with feature/problem,
  primary evidence, user scenario, current Waxwing state, proposed decision
  (adopt/adapt/defer/reject), rationale, prerequisites, risks, backlog/ADR
  owner and a concrete future acceptance test/property.
- [ ] Reconcile with FN001, K001, C001/R001, FX001, M001, D001, STD001,
  I001 and L001/J001 rather than duplicating their tracking.
- [ ] Review interactions explicitly: currying versus effect timing;
  generic instances versus rank-1 records; rows versus specialization;
  open errors versus exhaustive handling; handlers versus resources and
  cancellation; total helper laws versus effectful callbacks; modules and
  FFI versus abstraction/validation boundaries.

## Task 4: Resolve concrete application scenarios

- [ ] Walk through lawful bimap on a user-defined bifunctor and generic
  mapping/chaining across optional values and fixed-error results.
- [ ] Walk through overlapping service requirements with real/fake
  substitution, missing-capability diagnostics and inferred effect rows.
- [ ] Walk through clock/UUID/database creation, MileAhead-style error
  widening, context-only wrapping, partial handling and exhaustive closure.
- [ ] Walk through cleanup on failure; propose async/cancellation scenarios
  only if FX001 scope includes them, otherwise mark them deferred.
- [ ] Walk through modules sharing pure domain code, safe foreign ingress,
  practical text/numbers/collections, and the proposed web/native targets.
  Sketches are not working demonstrations until independently tested.
- [ ] Walk through an IDE diagnostic on an incomplete edit, a failing
  doctest located in its document, a shrunk/replayed property failure, and
  discovery of a version-correct API/example by a coding agent. Evaluate
  literate authoring as an explicit optional decision, not a requirement.
- [ ] Walk through a Waxwing library, a typed host SDK binding and a service
  adapter/fake; review host-facing exports, provider conformance, package
  identity, locked transitive host dependencies, conflicts and fresh/offline
  builds. State portability limits and source-versus-binary linking choices.

## Task 5: Review and durable handoff

- [ ] Obtain an independent review of evidence, missing basics, incompatible
  semantics and unnecessary complexity; record resolved findings.
- [ ] Present a proposed early-release feature set and a deliberate
  omission list to the user. Resolve substantive scope decisions before
  updating implementation designs or marking them approved.
- [ ] Update affected ADRs/backlog/design docs with traceable decisions;
  leave unknowns as specific research items with a next action.

## Timing and completion gate

Keep FN001's approved delivery moving. Run this audit before settling the
shared K001/C001/R001/FX001 designs; feed each relevant subsystem brief into
its review and STD001's API coverage work. No design should claim audit
coverage before its relevant sources and interaction checks are reviewed.

LA001 is complete only with twelve reviewed briefs, a source/section ledger,
the decision matrix, interaction findings, independent review and durable
handoff. Survey completion does not authorize implementing every feature.
Higher-ranked types, GADTs/type families, dependent/indexed machinery and
explicit effect-row constraint syntax retain their existing deferrals.
Any revision requires its own reviewed scope decision. Existing verification
and evidence rules apply to changes; proposed features are not validated
by the current compiler suite.
